/**
 * Symbol light classes are not materializing declarations with value classes in signatures, because mostly
 * they have mangled names which cannot be called from Java, so we don't need them.
 * And such declarations are filtered out by [hasTypeForValueClassInSignature].
 *
 * So there is no need for trying to unwrap classes in signatures of such declarations.
 * But we still have a few places there we have valid Java names, so we have to unwrap value classes if:
 * - They are in the return type position of top-level callable. Such declarations don't have a mangled name.
 * - Backing fields. They don't have mangled names as each class may have only one filed with the same name.
 * - Declarations with [JvmName] annotation. This annotation overrides the mangled name, so such declarations
 * are accessible from Java.
 * - Constructors may have value classes. In this case they will have `private` modifier.
 *
 * @return **true** if [this] method may have a value class in signature
 *
 * @see hasTypeForValueClassInSignature
